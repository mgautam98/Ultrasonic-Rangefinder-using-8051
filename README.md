## Objective
- The objective of this experiment is to built a Ultrasonic rangefinder using 8051 Microcontroller and Ultrasonic Sensor which measures the distance up to 4 meters.

## Requirements
- 8051 Microcontroller
- 16X2 LCD Unit
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Jumper wires

###  Software Requirements
- Keil Uvision 3
- Programming language: C Language

## Introduction
#### Principle of Ultrasonic Rangefinder
- Generally, the distance can be measured using pulse echo method. The ultrasonic module
transmits a signal to the object, then receives echo signal from the object and produces output
signal whose time period is proportional to the distance of the object. The mechanism of the
ultra sonic sensor is similar to the RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging).  

This circuit calculates the distance of the object based on the speed of the sound wave at normal temperature and displays the distance on LCD.
